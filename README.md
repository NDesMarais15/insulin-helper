## What it does
Our app allows users to search for a variety of foods, categorized as either branded or generic foods, and find both the carbohydrates for that food and the corresponding amount of insulin they should administer to themselves, based on their insulin to carbohydrate ratio. Our app also provides calorie and protein information for the given food because, although not necessarily relevant to diabetics, many users want these metrics, and this makes it easy for them to find. The user can also favorite foods for permanent use, and easily remove their favorites. Written by Nick DesMarais and Michael Windlinger.
